# Habits that will make your digital life safer

## Free software

### Free is not Gratis

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

### Open Source

- Open source means security, all the community is able to detect and fix security issues.
- Community driven security has been proved to be more efficient in core security projects.

## Updates

That's easy: Just update your software. Specially OS and applications.

Uninstall unused software. Tip (If you installed an app and you didn't use it in a week probably you won't use it ever again)

## Backups

### Information security policy

If you lost your phone? If your computer breaks?...

Back up your information on a regular basis.

- No confidential: online backup (MEGA, sync.com)
- Confidential: Encryption + USB sticks

On cloud providers look for: End to End encryption and security reviews.
